                        <h4>Implementing Price Comparison API into Travel Apps</h4>
                        <p>One of my very first case study I completed while attending UC Davis's UX/UI Bootcamp. The design challenge was to design a travel app that responded to the needs of a frequent traveler and find ways to make travel planning easier for our users. Currently, the case study is in it's first iteration.</p>

                        <p>In less than 72 hours, my team and I created a travel app for UCSB's Designathon 2022. Our design challenge was to create an app that increases the user experience of travel planning.  We created Tripcision focused on making collaborative travel planning less stressful and more enjoyable.</p>

                        <p>In this case study, we were split into groups and given full freedom of what problem we wanted to tackle. We ultimately designed a low-key but valuable music app that curates music based on a survey about your mood, task, or environment.</p>
